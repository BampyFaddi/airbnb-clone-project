## üß© UI Component Patterns

### Why Component Patterns Matter
In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface.  
Using consistent design patterns ensures:

   - Displays links to Home, Listings, and Login/Register  
   - Responsive design (hamburger menu for mobile)  

2. **Property Card**  
   - Image, title, price, and short description  
   - Reusable in both search results and featured listings  

3. **Search & Filter Form**  
   - Location, date, price range filters  
   - Reusable for refining results  

4. **Booking Form**  
   - Collects user details, dates, and payment info  
   - Includes input validation  

5. **Modal & Dialogs**  
   - Used for login/signup popups and booking confirmation  

6. **Buttons & Inputs**  
   - Styled consistently (primary, secondary, disabled states)  
   - Reusable across forms and pages
